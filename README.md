# FeudalMP 4.0

## General
New iteration of my hobby project FeudalMP. 4.0 stands for the new game engine version used for this.

___
## What
FeudalMP is sort of my p-o-c/hobby project to create a standalone game version of the popular Persistent World type mods for Mount & Blade Warband games. 

Fittingly this is probably the 4th actual attempt at trying to make this work. The good thing is, that the game engine is really easy to use, however the scope of this project is kinda insane for one person.

## "Roadmap"
First things first, there will be a lot of dummies and placeholders in this game. My expertise is really only on the codeing side of things; sound, textures, 3d models, animations, ui etc. is for someone else to add to this game ;)...

1. Network code
2. Some debug UI stuff
3. 3D stuff and the first world&characters
4. Trying to implement some multiplayer gameplay stuff to do on the 3d worlds
5. Refinement(UI, Textures, 3d Models etc.)
6. We see how it goes from here
